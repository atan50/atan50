We noticed that accessing http://localhost:5000/static/foo
does not have any text on the webpage. We predicted that
nothing would happen since there is no code for the program
to read or run.

However, when the HTML file is run, "Is this plaintext, though?"
is displayed on the local webpage. We predicted that the page 
would generate the text since the document type and html tags
were properly included (and closed).
