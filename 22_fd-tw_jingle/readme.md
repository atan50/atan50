DISCO:
1. Tailwind uses the ```<script>``` tag for CDN, while Bootstrap and Foundation use the ```<link>``` tag to import CSS stylesheets.
2. Tailwind customizations are split into many classes, much variation.
3. Foundation and Bootstrap are similar in the naming style of classes.

QCC:
1. What does ```data-active-collapse="true"``` do in Foundation? Nothing changed when we removed it.
2. We notice that placeholders are nice features (light gray, default fonts)
3. Tailwind CSS for individual divs may get very long since styling is not centralized for certain functionalities.

q1:

I prefer Bootstrap because I appreciate the aesthetics of the bare functionalities. While Tailwind can also achieve this level, many classes will be used to reach the result due to the great nuance. I do not prefer the aesthetics of Foundation but I appreciate the straightforwardness of its functionalities.
